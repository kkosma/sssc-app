Thank you for inviting us to be part of Jane's graduation celebration. We're eager to see you all again. This event will make seeing you even more special.



We'll be arriving Thursday at 7:00 p.m. on flight 401. Thank you for offering to pick us up and getting us a room at the Doe Inn. You seem to think of everything.



We look forward to spending this time with you and getting better acquainted with Jane and her husband.
