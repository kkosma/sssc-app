In 2010, the Science Center purchased the Mill and Sage buildings taking over the hatchery and the aquarium. The purchase was made possible by an economic development grant from the City of Sitka, a grant from the Karsh Family Foundation and a loan from local commercial fishermen. The Science Center completed a $1.3 million exterior renovation in 2014 with funding from the Rasmuson Foundation, the M.J. Murdock Trust and the Ahlgren Family Fund.
