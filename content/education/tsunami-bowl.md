The Science Center  hosts a Sitka National Ocean Sciences Bowl team.  The state competition, the Alaskan Tsunami Bowl, is held in Seward each year in the Spring.  Throughout the school year, competing teams of 4-5 students create a project which involves a paper and presentation.  Students also compete head to head with other teams in a quiz-bowl style competition to display their ocean knowledge.
