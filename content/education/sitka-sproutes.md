Plant the Seeds of Science in the next generation! Tuesdays at 10:30 am September to April, 3-5 year olds gather at the Science Center for this free program. We read a story each week and do a craft or activity that relates to the topic of the story. Join us for some hands-on adventuring that is sure to get your tot thinking like a scientist. No registration is necessary, just stop on by. Please check out our Education calendar to confirm dates.
