The Science Center is proud to spread the word about a great opportunity for local students â€“ the Science Mentor Program. The program is funded by the Sitka Conservation Society and the Rural Schools Recovery Act. This program pairs Sitka High School students with a scientist mentor from the community. Participating organizations include the Sitka Sound Science Center, University of Alaska-Southeast, U.S. Forest Service, and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. These students are working on a research project with their mentor throughout the school year, learning valuable scientific methods, and earning high school credit. If you are a local student and would like to participate, please contact Janet Clarke.
