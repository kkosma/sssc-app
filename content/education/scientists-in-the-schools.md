SSSCâ€™s Scientists in the School is a unique program that provides rural students exposure to a wide discipline of sciences by implementing hands on and engaging classroom experiences with professional scientists. This 20 year program has been perfected over the last two decades and is now a carefully coordinated, strategic science education system that is executed by facilitating working scientists into the curriculum at each grade level in Sitka schools, creating a pipeline of authentic scientific experiences during the entire academic career of Sitka youth.
