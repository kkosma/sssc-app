The Sitka Sound Science Center offers a variety of academic support for schools and universities looking to conduct field courses in Southeast Alaska through our Field Station. SSSC provides lab space, classrooms, inorganic and organic specimens, as well as access to our saltwater aquarium and touch tanks. We strive to provide the hands on experiences and support necessary for quality, interdisciplinary field work here in Sitka, Alaska. Schools and universities bring their instructors, their students, and their classes to Sitka, where SSSC staff and associates provide local knowledge, transportation, field trip coordination, expertise in outdoor recreation and additional support. The former Sheldon Jackson College campus (owned and operated by the Sitka Fine Arts Camp) can provide housing, dining services and recreational facilities.
