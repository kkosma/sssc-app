A library is at the heart of every institution that seeks to understand our world and to expand our knowledge of it. It is a requirement for the accreditation of every institution of higher learning in the US. A library is a physical symbol of the network through which knowledge is made available and shared. It represents books, but far more, in our Internet world, it represents access in our workplaces, our homes and the field to information that helps and confirms what we seek to do.

Margaret and David earned PhDs at Yale University. They both taught at Emory University, and later Margaret became Professor in the Psychiatry Department at the University of California, Davis, School of Medicine and Associate Dean of the Medical School. David taught at The Pacific School of Religion and The Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley where he worked as Convener of the GTU Inter-Area PhD program and Dean of Advanced Professional Studies at PSR. They collaborated on research dealing with children and families at risk as they taught and published together.

Margaret and David have supported what they see as the core of the Sitka Sound Science Center. They have helped us link with colleges and research institutions to advocate for the experiences of the natural world which Sitka has to offer their studies and research efforts. They have helped us organize Sitka community resources to serve students and researchers who come here. They suggested the concept of “Field Station” as a way to understand our commitment to the complex relationships involved in matching students and researchers with the incredible natural resources available in Sitka. They are helping us develop programs that express our identity as a Field Station in a sustainable way.
