Funded by US Geological Survey (USGS), this grant will fund an international team of scientists to examine the Queen Charlotte/Fairweather Fault, an earthquake zone off the coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska. Researchers will utilize the Canadian Coast Guard Oceanographic Science Vessel John P. Tully to survey areas of recent earthquake activity along the fault. Former SSSC Scientist in Residency Fellow, Dr. Gary Greene (Moss Landing Marine Laboratory and Tombolo Research) and Dr. Vaughn Barrie (Geological Survey of Canada) are the principle investigators for this study.
