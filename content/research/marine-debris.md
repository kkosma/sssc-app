The Sitka Sound Science Center has been involved in Marine Debris research, cleanup, and outreach since our inception. We have partnered with the F/V Cherokee and the Marine Conservation Alliance who have been cleaning Sitka area beaches of marine debris since 2008. Together we have removed over 80,000 pounds of marine debris from the Southeast outer coast.
