This Engagment Student Learning Design and Development Level 1 project will contribute to the field of STEM education by exploring the benefits of attendance of a focused reading course and attendance at a science symposium. This project builds on previous NSF work and creates a community of undergraduate learners among students from rural backgrounds across coastal geographic areas that will meet and share learning experiences at Sitka WhaleFest, a rare science symposium for a broad audience in Sitka, Alaska, a community of 9,000 that is heavily dependent on marine resources culturally and economically. This relatively low-tech approach to improving STEM undergraduate learning experiences can shift attitudes among rural undergraduates from diverse backgrounds (AAAS, NSF). These attitudes will translate into improved rates of STEM declared majors and enthusiasm for STEM careers. This project will demonstrate to students and faculty how hands on learning and making research accessible and relevant while changing attitudes about educational and career pathways in the STEM fields. It will also provide science communication training that will help students put scientific ideas into the real world context and provide training in how to utilize scientific gatherings to further investigate STEM careers.
