SSSC, in partnership with Prince William Sound Science Center and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, is part of a $4.5 million, five year study on straying rates of hatchery fish into wild streams around Southeast and Prince William Sound. In Alaska our hatchery programs for commercial fisheries are stakeholder driven and overseen by fishermen who strongly support Alaskaâ€™s mandate to protect wild stocks while enjoying the economic opportunities derived from renewable resources that are well managed. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game and private hatchery operators have recognized the need for a research program addressing concerns about escapement assessment, and genetic and ecological interactions between hatchery and wild stocks.
