The Belted Kingfisher is a stocky bird with a large, crested head. It is a slate blue color, with a white underside and collar around the neck. They have a long, solid bill, which is longer than their head, and small white spots by each eye. The females are actually more colorful, a trait not common in birds, and has a rust colored band on her belly. They are considered an opportunistic carnivore, with fish being their preferred prey. When prey is spotted, they dive headfirst straight into the water to catch it, then they take it up to a tree limb, where they swallow it whole, head first. They have few natural predators, but are prey to some falcon species.
Belted Kingfishers are seasonally monogamous, and, after courtship, the pair will work together to excavate a nesting cavity close to a fishing site. After mating, the female lays 5-8 eggs in the cavity, and is the primary incubator of the eggs, though the male will help sometimes. The eggs hatch after 23 or 24 days, and the chicks will fledge after about 23 days. During that time, the young are fed by both parents. After they fledge, the parents will train the young how to hunt, by dropping fish in the water and making the young retrieve it. After about 3 weeks, the chicks have learned to hunt enough to be on their own.
Kingfisher’s have never really been hunted by humans, and don’t have a lot of natural predation pressure. Their populations are considered stable across their range. They don’t seem to be as susceptible to changing environmental factors or contaminants, which has probably aided in their success.
