Common mergansers are the largest of the merganser species, and the largest North American inland duck. They are most commonly associated with wooded lakes and rivers, and, while rare in the ocean, can be found in estuaries. The males have a black back, green to black head, lacking a crest, a red bill and feet, and a white, cylindrical body. Females have a large crest, brown head, less sharply defined colors on the body, with more of a blend of gray and white. They feed primarily on fish, and their bill is serrated to help them catch fish. They will also dive for crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians, and other aquatic prey. They are considered a top predator in aquatic food chains, and no predators of adults have been documented.

Common mergansers for monogamous mating pairs that last at least a season, but could possibly last for longer. A female lays a clutch of between 9-12 eggs, and she incubates the eggs for 28-35 days. Within two days, the young will leave the nest and travel with their mother to the feeding grounds. Once there, they fend for themselves, with their mother only providing alerts to dangers. The young become skilled divers after about 8 days, and their mother leaves them at about 30 days, before they have developed the ability to fly.

Common mergansers are prevalent in their range, and are not considered to be threatened. They are, however, susceptible to nesting site loss due to urbanization and coastal development. It is a protected species under the US Migratory Bird Act, even though populations are not declining or threatened.
