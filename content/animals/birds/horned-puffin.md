The Horned Puffin is a pelagic bird that nests on the rocky outer coasts of Alaska. They are primarily black and white in color, with a white underside and face, and black on their back. This color pattern, called countershading, is actually a form of camouflage, where the light belly blends into the background when viewed from below, and the dark blends in with the water when viewed from above. They have a large bill, that turns a bright orange and yellow during breeding season, and is used to attract mates. They are monomorphic, meaning males and females look the same. Sexually mature animals have a small, fleshy black “horn” over their eyes, which gives the animal its name. Puffins are diving birds, meaning they will dive well below the surface to catch small fish and crustaceans. They have spines on their tongues and the roof of their mouths, which allows them to capture and carry several small fish at once (up to 80 sand eels).

Puffins are colonial breeders. They migrate to coastal rocky coasts during the summer months to mate. They will scratch out burrows in the rocky cliffs, sometimes 1-3 feet deep. The female will lay one egg, and the parents will take turns incubating it for about 38-43 days, as well as feeding it. Unlike a lot of other birds, Puffin’s don’t regurgitate food for their chicks, but rather bring whole fish back for them. The chicks fledge after 38-44 days, and often tumble into the water below the nest site, since they are poor fliers, where they will swim out to sea.
Puffins are considered a species of least concern, although they have been used historically for food and clothing by Alaska Natives. They have seen increased predation in recent years by rats or foxes that have been introduced to breeding areas, and are extremely susceptible to oil spills and other pollution. They are still abundant in Alaska, but have declined in the lower 48. There are an estimated 1.2 million breeding puffins in the world.
