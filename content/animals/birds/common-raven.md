The common raven is the largest of the “perching birds” or “songbirds”, often being the same size as hawks. They are solid black in color, with a thick neck and shaggy throat feathers, a large, stout bill and wedge-shaped tail feathers. They have a large range of vocalizations, from chirps to cries to cat-like meows. They are omnivorous, and notorious scavengers, often getting into trash cans and being found around dumps. They will hide food supplies, and are known to raid others bird’s food supplies. Like owls and hawks, ravens will regurgitate what they can’t digest in pellets, which gives researchers insight into what the animals are eating.


Ravens will mate for life, and reach sexual maturity at about 3-4 years old. The female lays a clutch of 3-7 eggs, and is the sole incubator of the eggs, with the male bringing her food while in the nest. Chicks hatch after about 3 weeks, and fledge about 4 weeks after that, even though the young will remain with the parents after fledging.
Historically, ravens have been found throughout the entire United States, but disappeared completely from the east and Midwest before 1900, and have only recently been seen expanding back into these territories. Ravens have long been honored in Native American cultures, most often being known as a trickster. The most common is the story of The Raven and the Sun, which tells of how the raven stole the light of the universe from a man (or eagle, depending in the culture) who had hidden it for his own pleasure, and released it for all to enjoy, creating the sun, moon, and stars.
