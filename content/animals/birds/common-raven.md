The bald eagle, the national symbol of the United States, is one of the most easily identifiable birds in Alaska. They are a large bird, with dark brown feathers, a white head and tail, and yellow beak and feet. Juveniles are mottled brown and white. They are a raptor, meaning they are a predatory hunter, but they are also opportunistic scavengers, feeding in carrion and dead fish. They feed primarily on fish, but will feed on other birds or small mammals when fish are scarce. They are known to steal food from Osprey by waiting for one to return to its nest with food and harassing it until it drops it.

It is believed bald eagles mate for life. They reach sexual maturity at about 5 years old, with females laying typically two eggs per season. The eggs are guarded by both parents, who will take turns hunting, for 34-36 days. The young will stay in the nest for 10-12 weeks before fledging.

Bald eagles are a wildlife conservation success story. For years, they were hunted for sport and to protect fishing grounds. Those activities, together with the use of the pesticide DDT, almost wiped out bald eagle populations. DDT and other pesticides collect in the tissues of fish, which are then ingested by eagles and cause reproductive problems. Restricting the use DDT in 1972, and protecting bald eagles under the Endangered Species Act, has led to a rebound of populations. They have recovered so well that they were removed from the endangered species list in 2007, and are now designated as “least concern”.
