The great blue heron is the largest and most common heron in North America. They are mostly blue-gray in color, with a wide, black stripe over their eyes. They have long legs, perfect for wading in estuaries and wetlands, and long necks that they can tuck back or extend out. A subspecies found in southern Florida and the Caribbean is completely white, and was once thought to be a different species entirely. They are predatory, considered an expert fisher. While fish are an important part of their diet, they are also known to prey on mice, small reptiles and amphibians, and insects.

Great blue heron’s breed in colonies, high in trees in areas that are difficult to get to. They are socially monogamous within a season, but will chose a new mate each year. The female lays three to six eggs, and both parents will incubate the eggs, which hatch after about 27 days. The young will fly for the first time at about 2 months, but will stay with their parents and return to the nest for about 3 weeks after their first flight.

While heron have never been exploited or threatened as some other birds have, they still face pressures from humans. Loss of habitat due to construction and pollution are the biggest threats they face. There are very few predators of adult birds, but the young face a wider threat from other birds and mammals. While they have been shot occasionally, due to their large size and being an easy target, they have never been hunted extensively by humans and are considered a species of Least Concern.
