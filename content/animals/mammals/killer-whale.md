The killer whale, or orca, is the largest member of the dolphin family, and probably the most easily recognized cetacean in the world. They are predominantly black in color, with a white underside, large white eye patches and a grayish white saddle behind the dorsal fin. Males are typically much larger than females, and have a taller and straighter dorsal fin than females. They have round, paddle-like pectoral flippers that help in steering and stopping in the water.

Orcas are the top predator in the ocean, and are one of the top in the world. They feed on everything from large fish, squid, and seabirds, up to marine mammals, such as seals and sea lions and baby whales. They have even been observed eating Great White Sharks near the Farallon Islands in northern California. They often hunt in groups, like wolves, which has led to them being called the “wolves of the sea”. They have adapted different hunting techniques depending on where they are and what prey they are going after. In South America, they often swim right up onto the beach to capture seals; in Antarctica, a group will swim at an ice floe with a seal on it then dive beneath at the last second, causing a wave over the floe that will push the seal off into the water; in Norway, they will use their flukes to slap at large schools of herring, killing fish that they can then eat at their leisure.

Orcas are incredibly intelligent and highly adaptable. They are able to communicate with each other through a series of clicks and whistles, and they can teach their young about where to hunt, where to avoid, hunting techniques, etc. They don’t really migrate, as many other marine mammals do, but can travel far distances in search of food. Most populations around the world can be divided into distinct groups; in Alaska, we have resident Orca, which feed predominantly on fish, transient Orca, which feed more on marine mammals, and the offshore Orca, which not a lot is known about.

While Orca weren’t hunted as extensively as some other species, they have faced pressure from humans. More than being hunted for oil or blubber, Orca were the target of live-capture hunters, where the animals would be sold to facilities around the world. Some countries still capture them for human entertainment, though the global pressure to end this practice completely is rising. Not a lot is known about the overall population numbers of Orca around the world, so the animal has not been listed as “endangered” or “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. It is, however, protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and some smaller distinct population segments, such as southern resident populations, where the numbers are known, have been listed as endangered.
