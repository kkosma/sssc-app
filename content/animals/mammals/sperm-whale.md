The sperm whale is the largest toothed whale in the oceans. It also has the largest brain of any creature that has ever lived. They are a dark gray or brown in color, and have a massive head, which is about 1/3 of its total body length. Their pectoral flippers are relatively short and stubby. One of the features of the sperm whale is the cavity in the head that holds the spermaceti oil, which is a yellowish-white wax substance that early hunters thought was sperm. This oil is thought to aid in buoyancy control when diving and acts as an acoustic lens.

Sperm whales are one of the deepest diving mammals in the world, usually diving to around 400 meters, but they have been known to dive 2-3 kilometers. While they hold their breath on average of 45 minutes, they can hold it for up to 2 hours. This diving ability helps them to hunt for one of their favored prey items, giant squid. They are also known to eat fish, octopuses, rays and some sharks. They have also made a mark on popular culture, being the inspiration behind Herman Melville’s Moby Dick.

Sperm whales are intelligent and capable of learning. In southeast Alaska, their ability to learn and adapt new hunting techniques has led to conflict with commercial longlining fisherman. Sperm whales have learned that when longlining fishing gear is being hauled in, there is a readily available food source on the lines that they don’t have to hunt for. They know the sound the gear makes when it is being hauled in, and have learned how to strip the lines of all the fish, and not get entangled in the process. The Southeast Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project, SEASWAP, is one of the research projects that SSSC is involved with that is looking at ways for fisherman to avoid whales.

Sperm whales were heavily targeted by commercial whalers in the 18- and 1900’s. It is estimated that populations were decimated by half, if not 75%. They were targeted for their oil and spermaceti, which is some of the highest quality oil for use in lamps, and also for ambergris, a substance that forms in their intestines as a way to protect against undigestible animal parts, which is used in perfume. Populations have started to recover since the whaling ban was implemented, with an estimated count of around 200,000 whales. While they are not considered endangered, they are listed as a “vulnerable” species.
