Harbor seals are phocids, or true seals. They lack external ear flaps and are not able to rotate their hind flippers, like otariids, so they move along by flopping on their bellies. They are typically mottled in appearance, with white or silver-gray fur and black or dark brown spots. The males are larger than females, and animals in the north Pacific are larger than their Atlantic counterparts. They can often be seen hauled out on beaches, with their head and flippers raised in the air in a banana pose.

Harbor seals do not migrate, and prefer coastal temperate regions, with rocks, beaches, or glacial ice available as haul-outs. They are one of the most widespread pinnipeds. Their diet consists mainly of fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and shellfish. They can dive to about 450 meters and hold their breath for about 40 minutes, but the average dive time is 3-7 minutes. The most common predator of harbor seals in the Orca, but they have been known to fall prey to sharks, sea lions, and land predators, such as wolves and bears.

Like all marine mammals, harbor seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. There is still a subsistence take of these animals, which are a crucial part of the native diets and culture in Alaska. The subsistence take is around 2,000 animals each year. There is notable conflict with commercial fishermen, since they have developed a knack for removing fish from gillnets. This sometimes lead to illegal shooting by frustrated fishermen, or by animals getting entangled in fishing gear. They are considered a species of “Least Concern”, meaning population numbers are stable or increasing, and they have not suffered catastrophic population decline. There are an estimated 600,000 harbor seals in the world.
