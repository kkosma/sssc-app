Sea otters are the largest member of the weasel family, although they are the smallest marine mammal in the world. They have the thickest fur of any animal in the world, with roughly 1 million hairs per square inch. Their fur is in two layers, an undercoat and thick guard hairs. This configuration traps a layer of air next to the animal’s skin, which prevents it from getting wet. Sea otters do not have a thick blubber layer for warmth, like many cold-water mammals, so their thick fur provides that warmth. They are often dark brown in color, with lighter color guard hairs. They have webbed hind feet, for swimming.

Sea otters are often associated with kelp forests. The kelp provides vital habitat and feeding grounds for otters. They spend almost all their time in water, so they often wrap themselves in kelp fronds when they are sleeping, to keep them from drifting. While they will eat a variety of items, including clams, octopuses, fish, and a variety of invertebrates, sea urchins are a particular favorite, which can often be found in kelp forests. They often use rocks placed on their chest as a tool to crack open hard-shelled animals, such as urchins and clams. The relationship between otter populations and healthy kelp forests has played out dramatically in southeast Alaska. When otter populations are down, urchin populations increase, and they can wipe out the kelp beds. When otters are present to keep the urchins in check, the kelp forests thrive.

Sea otters are listed as “endangered” under the endangered species act. They used to have a more extensive range, going south into Baja California and Japan, but extensive hunting by Russian fur traders in the 17- and 1800’s almost wiped out the populations, and, in fact, did wipe them out in some areas. By 1911, population numbers were down to about 2,000 total individuals. A fur trade treaty was signed in 1911 which resulted in protections of sea otters, and the numbers have rebounded. In central and southeast Alaska, numbers are increasing, but they are still declining in western Alaska. The biggest threats facing otters today are increased predation, fishery interactions, disease, and man-made threats like oil spills. While some areas are seeing an increase in otters, the numbers are still below the carrying capacity of the environment, which is keeping the animals listed as endangered.
