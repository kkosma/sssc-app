Steller sea lions are the fourth largest pinniped, after northern and southern elephant seals and walruses, and are the largest otariid, which are the eared seals and sea lions. Their fur is light tan to reddish brown in color, and they have a large, somewhat boxy shaped head. As with most pinnipeds, the males are larger than the females, and have longer fur around their heads, which resembles a lion’s mane. Their fore-flippers are larger than the hind ones, and are the primary means of locomotion, and, like all otariids, they can rotate their hind flippers forward and “walk” on land. When in large groups, they tend to vocalize with deep “roars”, as opposed to the “barking” noise made by their smaller relatives, the California sea lion.

While Steller sea lions do not migrate, they have been known to move their haul-out location to follow prey items. They are considered generalist predators, and will feed on many types of fish and cephalopods, as well as the occasional bird or true seal. They can dive to about 400 meters to find food, which they often swallow whole underwater.

There are two distinct populations of Steller sea lions: the western and eastern stocks, with the dividing line being near 144˚W longitude, just east of Cape Suckling, Alaska. In 1990, Steller sea lions were listed as threatened across their range, with the western stock being listed as endangered in 1997. Eastern stock numbers have been increasing, and they were de-listed in 2013, while the western stock has been showing stability. Steller sea lions were hunted for their meat, fur and oil in the 1800’s, and were often shot by fisherman who saw them as a nuisance and competitor for fish. They are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act, but illegal hunting and shooting still occurs, as does a subsistence harvest. The areas within 20 nautical miles of haul-outs and rookeries have been designated as “critical habitat”, meaning the area has features which are essential to the conservation and protection of the animals.
