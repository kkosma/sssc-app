While not as widely sought after as the King salmon, Coho are still a target species for commercial and sports fisheries. Ocean going adults are bright silver, with small black spots on the back and upper lobe of the tail fin. During spawning, they turn a dark red or maroon color, with a dark head and back, and males develop a large hooked upper jaw, or kype. Coho fry in fresh water feed on aquatic insects, plankton, and one recently deposited salmon eggs. At sea, they eat mainly fish and squid. Predators include whales, sharks, marine and terrestrial mammals, birds, and humans.

All salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in fresh water and spend a certain amount of time there before migrating to salt water, where they mature and spend their adult lives. At the end of their lives, they return to the same stream they were born in to spawn, then they die. It is believed a salmon finds its way back to its home river using two methods: geomagnetism, which is essentially a compass in the animal’s brain that brings them into the general area, and a finely developed sense of smell, which leads them into the river system. The Coho female will dig a nest, or redd, where she deposits between 2,400 and 4,500 eggs, which are fertilized by the male as she deposits them. After about 3 months, they hatch into alevin, and stay in the gravel, living off their yolk sac, until early summer. In the fall, the fry will swim miles off, into off-channel habitats where they can winter over without the risk of floods. They will spend one to three winters in streams before migrating out to saltwater. Most fish remain in the open ocean for 18 months before returning to spawn, although some males, called “jacks”, will return after only 6 months at sea.
