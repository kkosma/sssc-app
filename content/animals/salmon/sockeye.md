Sockeye salmon are highly prized for their firm, bright orange flesh, which is a result of the krill and plankton they eat in the wild. They are considered the most economically important species of salmon in Alaska, because they are a higher quality and sell for a higher price than pinks. Ocean going adults have a metallic blue-green back, iridescent silver sides and white belly. When they return to freshwater to spawn, they turn a bright red color with a green head, and the males develop a hump on their back and a hooked nose, called a kype. Their diet consists mainly of zooplankton, small crustaceans, and small fish. Marine mammals and bears are the main predators of sockeye salmon.

All salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in fresh water and spend a certain amount of time there before migrating to salt water, where they mature and spend their adult lives. At the end of their lives, they return to the same stream they were born in to spawn, then they die. It is believed a salmon finds its way back to its home river using two methods: geomagnetism, which is essentially a compass in the animalâ€™s brain that brings them into the general area, and a finely developed sense of smell, which leads them into the river system. Female sockeyes will lay between 2,000-5,000 eggs in one or more nests, called redds. The eggs hatch in the winter, and the alevin remain in the gravel until their yolk sacs are absorbed, emerging in the spring as fry. If they are in a system that has lakes, they may spend between 1-3 years in freshwater before migrating to open ocean. If there are no lakes, they tend to migrate to ocean as soon as they emerge from the gravel. They spend 1-3 years in the ocean before returning to spawn.
