Pink salmon are the smallest of the Pacific salmon species, and they have the shortest lifespan. They are also the most abundant, and play a vital role in commercial fisheries. Adults in the ocean are a bright greenish-blue on top, with silvery sides. They develop large black spots as they get closer to returning to freshwater. Once they have returned to freshwater, the males turn brown or black on top, with white bellies, and they develop a hooked beak, known as a kype, and a large hump on their backs. Females turn an olive green with dusky bars or patches. Salmon fry in freshwater may eat aquatic insects and zooplankton. Adults eat plankton, shrimp, krill, smaller fish, and squid. They are prey to anything bigger than them, including bears, birds, humans, and marine mammals.

All salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in fresh water and spend a certain amount of time there before migrating to salt water, where they mature and spend their adult lives. At the end of their lives, they return to the same stream they were born in to spawn, then they die. It is believed a salmon finds its way back to its home river using two methods: geomagnetism, which is essentially a compass in the animalâ€™s brain that brings them into the general area, and a finely developed sense of smell, which leads them into the river system. A female pink lays between 1,200 and 1,900 eggs in up to four nests, called redds, while the male swims next to her and fertilizes the eggs. She will guard the redd until she dies. The eggs hatch into alevin after a few months, and stay buried in the gravel until their yolk sacs are completely absorbed. Once they emerge from the gravel, they immediately head towards the ocean, where they will spend about 18 months before returning to their home river to spawn.
