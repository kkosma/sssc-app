Until recently, chum salmon were considered the least desirable catch for commercial and sport fisheries. While still not highly sought by sports fishermen, chum salmon have become more valuable because of their roe, which is marketed as salmon caviar. In the ocean, chum are a metallic bluish-green along the back, silver along the sides, with a multitude of tiny speckles, and a highly forked tail with silver streaks along the fin rays. When they return to freshwater, males turn a dark olive or brown color, with red or purple vertical bands along their sides, and develop a large hooked beak, called a kype, and large teeth. Females turn to a brown or grey color, with a dark horizontal bar running along the lateral line, and develop a less noticeable kype. Fry in freshwater feed on insect larvae, then change to crustaceans, terrestrial insects and young herring before dispersing into deeper water. Adults feed on copepods, tunicates, mollusks, and small fish. They are prey for marine mammals, birds, humans, bears, and wolves.

All salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in fresh water and spend a certain amount of time there before migrating to salt water, where they mature and spend their adult lives. At the end of their lives, they return to the same stream they were born in to spawn, then they die. It is believed a salmon finds its way back to its home river using two methods: geomagnetism, which is essentially a compass in the animalâ€™s brain that brings them into the general area, and a finely developed sense of smell, which leads them into the river system. A chum female will lay around 2,000 eggs in a nest she has dug in the gravel, known as a redd, and the males will release the milt simultaneously to fertilize the eggs. The female will cover the redd with gravel and guard it until she is too weak to maintain her position. The eggs hatch in about 3-4 months, and the alevin remain in the gravel until their yolk sacs are depleted, about 60-90 days. The fry will begin their migration to sea within a few days or weeks, and will spend a few months in nearshore waters before dispersing to open ocean. They will spend 3-5 years at sea, before returning to freshwater to spawn.
