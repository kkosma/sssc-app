The Chinook, or King, salmon is the largest of the Pacific salmon species, and is often the most coveted by commercial and sports fishermen. Adult Chinook in the ocean are a deep-bodied fish with a bluish-green color on their back, and silver on the sides. They have large, irregular black spots on the back, dorsal and caudal fin, and have a black pigment along the gum line in their mouth. During spawning, colors change to a deep red or copper or dark gray, and the males develop a prominently hooked nose and upper jaw, called a kype, with bigger teeth. Juveniles feed on plankton and insects, while adults feed on a variety of other animals, including herring, squid, sandlance and crustaceans. Predators include birds, fish, marine mammals when the fish are in the open ocean, and land mammals, such as bears and river otters, when they are in freshwater.

All salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in fresh water and spend a certain amount of time there before migrating to salt water, where they mature and spend their adult lives. At the end of their lives, they return to the same stream they were born in to spawn, then they die. It is believed a salmon finds its way back to its home river using two methods: geomagnetism, which is essentially a compass in the animalâ€™s brain that brings them into the general area, and a finely developed sense of smell, which leads them into the river system. A Chinook female will lay between 3,000 and 14,000 eggs in several nests, known as redds, and the males will swim over the redd and release the milt to fertilize the eggs. The eggs hatch in about two months, and the babies are called alevin until they absorb their yolk sags. At that point, they are called a fry, and some will stay in the stream until their second year, while the rest will migrate to the ocean during their first year.
