The giant green anemone is a common sight in tidepools. This bright green anemone has a symbiotic relationship with algae, with the anemone getting extra nourishment from the algae, and the algae gaining protection from grazers and not having to compete for living space. Their diet consists of detached mussels, small fish, crabs, and urchins, with the occasional barnacle. Predators include the leather sea star, snails, some nudibranchs, and sea spiders. They are typically a solitary animal, but can be found in large aggregates if the conditions are favorable. While they donâ€™t often move once they have settled, the ability to do so exists, and they can move if the conditions become unfavorable.

Green anemones are one of the few species that do not reproduce asexually. They are broadcast spawners, with females releasing thousands of eggs at one time, often several times over a season, and the males releasing sperm into the water column. They can produce anywhere from 3000-9000 offspring in a season.
