The Oregon hairy triton is a large gastropod with a hairy or bristly shell. These bristles, called periostracum, keep other settling animals from growing on their shells. This snail is carnivorous, feeding on chitons, bivalves, tunicates, sea urchins, brittle stars, and other invertebrates. They are preyed upon by sea stars.

This snail produces sulfuric acid in its salivary gland, to aid in boring through the shells of prey. They also feed with a biting jaw, in addition to a radula. After mating, the female lays eggs in a counterclockwise pattern, with each cluster containing dozens of egg cases, and each case having 1600-2000 eggs. They are also the official state seashell of the state of Oregon.
