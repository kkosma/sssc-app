Different species of squat lobster are found all around the world. Some are found in shallow water, and some are known to inhabit areas surrounding hydrothermal vents. Despite their name, they are not a lobster at all, but a species of Galatheid crab, and are related to hermit crabs. They are dorsoventrally flattened, and have a long tail that curves under their body. Their front legs, containing the pinchers, are extremely long, often 2-3 times the animalsâ€™ total length. Their diet varies depending on their geographic location, from plankton to algae to dead plant and animal matter. Large fish and predators will eat squat lobsters.

There is not much known about the reproductive habits of squat lobsters. There are some commercial fisheries in central and south America, but none in north America.
