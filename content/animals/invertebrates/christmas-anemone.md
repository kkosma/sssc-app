The Christmas anemone (or painted anemone) gets its name from the red and green coloration found in most individuals, even though their colors can range to solid tan. They have roughly 100 tentacles that they use to capture prey items, such as crabs, fish, crustaceans, chitons, and sea urchins. The leather sea star and shag-rug nudibranch are both known predators of this anemone species.

The Christmas anemone can reproduce both sexually and asexually. They are broadcast spawners, meaning eggs and sperm are released into the water column at the same time and fertilization occurs. They can also divide asexually, and leave parts of themselves that will grow into a new anemone. If two of this species are placed too close together, they will engage in a type of “chemical warfare”, resulting in one of the animals dying.
