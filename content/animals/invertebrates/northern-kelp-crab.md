The northern kelp crab is one of a handful of crabs called “spider crabs”. Their carapace resembles a five-pointed sheriff’s badge, and is longer than it is wide. As their name suggests, they live predominantly in kelp beds, which is a primary food source in the summer, and their coloration depends on the type of kelp they are eating and living in (mostly light brown or greenish). They have a smooth carapace and long, sharply pointed legs that help them to climb and cling to kelp stipes and blades. While kelp and other algae are its primary food, they will switch to a more carnivorous diet in the winter time, when plant life is scarce, eating barnacles, hydroids, mussels, and bryozoans. Predators include staghorn sculpin, gulls, cabezon, and sea otters.

When kelp crabs reach sexual maturity, they undergo a “terminal molt”, meaning they will never molt again or grow any bigger. Just after this molt is when mating takes place. The female will hold the eggs in her abdominal sac, where she will aerate them and clean algae off them.
