The giant pink sea star is one of the largest sea stars in southeast Alaska, and an weigh up to 2 pounds. It has 5 arms that are thickest near the central disk. They are often found in areas of sand or mud, where they use their tube feet to dig down, looking for clams and sand dollars. They are also known to prey in mussels, barnacles, and sand dollars, as well as scavenge dead fish and squid. Predators include sharks, rays, and large bony fish. 

Sea stars are broadcast spawners, meaning the eggs and sperm are released into the water column simultaneously, where fertilization occurs. Larvae go through several developmental phases before settling and becoming a young sea star. Though the exact trigger is unknown, it is believed there is something in the environment that signals to the animals when it is time to spawn.
