The giant rock scallop is one of the largest scallop species. When they are young, they are free swimming, but as they grow, they settle on a hard surface and cement themselves down. The lower valve, or shell, often grows to the shape of the substrate it is cemented to, while the upper valve grows in a roughly circular shape. They are often difficult to spot due to other organisms, such as anemones, sponges, and algae, growing on their shells.

Rock scallops are filter feeders, and feed on plankton. Their main predators include the sunflower sea star and ochre sea star, as well as humans. While there is no commercial fishery for them, they are harvested for personal use. They are hermaphrodites.
