The morning sun star is considered by many to be the most feared and dangerous sea star, at least to other sea stars. It is a fairly large sea star, and is often solid orange or brown in color, with a smooth dorsal surface. They can have anywhere from 8-16 arms, but 11 or 12 is the average. The voracious predator moves relatively quickly, which enables them to overtake most of their desired prey. They feed mostly on other sea stars, such as leather stars, mottled sea stars, six-rayed sea stars, and even the larger sunflower star. They have also been known to feed on sea urchins and cucumbers. The only predator it faces is its own species; they are cannibalistic and often eat smaller members of their own kind.

Morning sun stars are broadcast spawners, usually releasing gametes from March to June. The pelagic larvae donâ€™t eat, but are able to swim around and disperse to other areas, before they develop into little sea stars. It is a solitary animal, with prey being the only other animals it comes into contact with.
