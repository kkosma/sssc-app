The grunt sculpin is a unique little fish that are often found in association with large acorn barnacles. They are small, with a pointed snout and fan-shaped tail. They are often found inhabiting empty barnacle shells, because when they sit nose-out, they look like a closed barnacle, and when they sit tail-out, they look like a feeding barnacle. They don’t have scales, but are instead covered in plates with minute spines on them. They are not the most agile of swimmers, and instead often use their pectoral fins to “walk” along the rocks and substrate. They feed on crustaceans, zooplankton, and fish larvae. The only known predator is the Pigeon Guillemot.

The grunt sculpin is oviparous, and has a unique method for mating. When the female is ready, she aggressively chases males until she corners one in a cave or crevice. She then lays her eggs, about 150, and stands guard until he fertilizes them. She then leaves the nest, leaving the male to guard the eggs.
