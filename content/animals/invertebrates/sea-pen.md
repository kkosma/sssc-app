The sea pen gets its name from the fact that it looks like an old-fashioned quill pen. They are a type of cnidarian, so they are related to sea anemones and jellyfish. They are a colonial animal, made up of dozens of polyps, with each polyp containing eight tentacles. When they are disturbed, they can expel all the water in their body and retract down into the bulbous foot at the base of the central stalk. They are bioluminescent and give off a blue-green color when agitated. They are planktonic filter feeders, and often orient themselves into a current to catch food. The leather star, sunflower star, and some nudibranchs feed on sea pens.

Sea pens are broadcast spawners, with eggs and sperm being released into the water column. The larvae drift as part of the plankton, then they metamorphose and settle to become the base of a new colony.
