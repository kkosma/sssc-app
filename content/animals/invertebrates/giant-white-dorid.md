The giant white dorid is one of the larger species of nudibranchs in southeast Alaska. It is oval shaped and completely white in color. Very rarely, one will have a pale yellowish hue. The lack of any dark markings is the easiest way to differentiate this dorid from similar species. They have seven fluffy gill plumes, that are circular and resemble a flower. Its rhinophores are small and, like the gill plumes, are retractable. It has small tubercles, which give it a bumpy appearance. They feed primarily on sponges, and are preyed upon by the rose sea star.

The giant white dorid is a hermaphrodite, containing both male and female reproductive organs. During mating, they act as both sexes, giving sperm to another individual and receiving sperm from that individual to fertilize the eggs, which are laid in ribbon-like masses and attached to the substrate.
