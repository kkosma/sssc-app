The giant Pacific chiton (or gumboot chiton) is the largest chiton species. A chitonâ€™s shell is made up of 6-8 overlapping plates, and, though it may not seem like it, the gumboot follows this, though their plates are covered with a leathery girdle, giving a smooth appearance. They eat mostly red algae, scraping it off rocks with their radula. The teeth of the radula are covered in magnetite, and contain enough that it can be picked up with a magnet. The only natural predator of the gumboot chiton is the lurid rock snail.

The girdle covering the shell of the chiton is made up of about 20 species of red algae growing on it, which gives the animal its color. This animal was a traditional item in the diet of native peoples. It is nocturnal, and can breathe air when exposed during a low tide.
