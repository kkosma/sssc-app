The clown nudibranch is a species of dorid, which means it has a flattened bottom. They are a translucent white or pale yellow in color, and are covered in bright orange spots and papillae. The clown nudibranch has the ability to crawl on the underside of the surface film of water, and is the largest nudibranch to be able to do so. Unlike other dorids, they canâ€™t retract their gills. They feed primarily on bryozoans, but they are avoided by most predators in tidepools, due to some type of chemical repellant.

The clown nudibranch is hermaphroditic, but they are unable to self-fertilize. When they mate, each individual transfers sperm to the other, and fertilization takes place internally. Later, they lay large, ribbon like egg masses in flat spirals on the rocks.
