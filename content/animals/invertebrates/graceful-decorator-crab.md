The graceful decorator crab gets its name from the way it attaches elements from its environment to its shell to camouflage itself. It uses the hooked setae, which cover its heart-shaped carapace, to hold on to the items and blend in. They are scavengers, and will eat any dead animals they can. Their main predator is the Pacific halibut.

While there are several species of decorator crabs, this one has the distinction of decorating itself the most. Adult males and females can differ significantly in appearance.
