The Plumose anemone is a large anemone found along the west coast of the United States. It has two types of tentacles, one set for feeding, and another for defense. Their defensive tentacles can break off at the tip when they detect other anemones, leaving dozens of nematocysts behind to deter the encroaching anemone. They are often found in large groups, and are a colonial animal. They are considered to be the world’s tallest polyp, and they are mobile, meaning they can move around quite a bit. They feed mostly on plankton and herring eggs, but are known to eat any small bits of meat that fall into their tentacles. Known predators are the leather sea star and some species of nudibranchs.

Like all anemones, plumose anemones reproduce both sexually and asexually. During spawning season, males and females release gametes into the water column, and the larvae disperse and eventually settle. For asexual reproduction, they use a technique called pedal laceration, where the animal moves off and leaves small bits behind, which grow into new anemones that are genetic clones of the “parent”.
