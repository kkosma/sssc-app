Brittle stars get their name from the fragility of their arms, which often break off if they are picked up by them. The daisy brittle star is a small brittle star that is found under rocks. They are radially symmetrical, and are often reddish in color, with dark bands on the arms. Often, the only part of the animal that is visible are its arms, which stick up in the water column, trying to catch planktonic food on the current. They are also known to eat detritus. Predators are larger fish and some species of duck.

In addition to being broadcast spawners, brittle stars can also reproduce asexually. A portion of the central disk and arms can split off, and as long as both sections have enough of the disk, both will live and regenerate more limbs to replace the ones lost.
