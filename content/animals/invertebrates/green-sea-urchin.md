The green sea urchin is a small urchin with short spines covering its body. While usually green in color, they can have reddish-brown or purple spines. Due to their smaller spines, they prefer areas out of direct surge. They feed primarily on giant kelp and other algae, although they will feed on dead fish or other animals that they come across. The main predators are sea otters, sunflower stars, crabs, and triton snails.

Urchins are broadcast spawners, with spawning usually occurring between June and September. Urchins are harvested by humans for the roe and gonads, which are considered a delicacy in Japan. The relationship between kelp beds, urchins, and sea otters has played out quite dramatically in southeast Alaska. When otters were wiped out from the area, the urchin populations exploded and wiped out the kelp forests, creating areas known as “urchin barrens”. With the reintroduction of otters, the urchin populations have declined and kelp forests have rebounded, which provide abundant habitat to various other species.
