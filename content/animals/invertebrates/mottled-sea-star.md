The mottled star is sometimes called the false ochre star due to its resemblance to the ochre star. They come in a wide variety of colors, from browns and blue-grays to pinks and oranges. While this animalâ€™s range extends as far south as California, it is not often seen south of Puget Sound. It has five long, narrow arms, with the widest point being apart from the central disk. These stars are known to regenerate an arm if one is lost. They prey on a variety of invertebrates, including bivalves, limpets, barnacles, snails, and tunicates. Predators include sunflower stars, large crabs, and sea gulls.

Like all sea stars, mottled stars are broadcast spawners, with spawning occurring between April and June. Large numbers of eggs and sperm are released into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The larvae are part of the zooplankton community, and are dispersed with the currents.
