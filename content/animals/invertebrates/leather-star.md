Unlike most sea stars that feel rough or bumpy to the touch, the leather star feels smooth, almost like wet leather. They have a mottled appearance, with colors varying from light gray to yellow to red. They eat anemones, urchins, cucumbers, and smaller sea stars. Its main predator is the morning sun star, of which the leather star composes about half the sun stars diet. It is sometimes called the garlic star, because it smells distinctly like garlic.

Leather stars are broadcast spawners, with males and females releasing gametes into the water column simultaneously, where fertilization takes place. The larvae become part of the zooplankton community until they grow into small sea stars.
