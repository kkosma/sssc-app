The spot prawn is the largest shrimp species found in Alaska. They are usually reddish brown or tan in color, with white horizontal bars on the carapace, and distinctive white spots on the first and fifth abdominal segments. They have five pairs of walking legs (pereopods) and 5 pairs of swimming legs (pleopods). They are nocturnal, opportunistic bottom feeders that will scavenge on whatever is available, including worms, diatoms, algae, small mollusks, sponges, and dead fish or shrimp. They are prey items for large predatory fish, such as halibut, salmon, flounder, Pacific cod, and pollock.

Spot prawns are protandric hermaphrodites. Juveniles most often form in males, until they reach a certain size, then they become females. They will reproduce during both stages. Before fertilization, a female will molt into a shell that has a specialized area for carrying the eggs. She broods them on her abdomen, and they are attached with a hair-like structure called setae. Populations in Alaska are considered stable, but there is a commercial fishery for spot prawns, although it mostly community based. The managers of the fishery have tried to ensure a sustainable, environmentally friendly harvest, so as to avoid the destruction seen by shrimp fisheries around the world.
