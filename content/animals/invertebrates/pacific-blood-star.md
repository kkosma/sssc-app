The Pacific blood star is one of the smaller sea star species in Alaska. They are often brick red or orange in color, but can have some paler yellow or beige. Their five arms are relatively long, thin, and stiff. They appear smooth, but are fairly rough to the touch. Their diet consists of sponges and bacteria, and are often preyed up by birds.

There is some speculation that the blood star is part of a species complex, meaning there could be potential several different sub-species that are currently associate with the same classification. More study is being done to determine the exact individual species that may exist.
