The six-rayed star is part of a larger “species complex”, which is a group of closely related species that are so similar in appearance that the boundaries between them are unclear. There are three distinct sub-species of Leptasterias hexactis that comprise the complex. This sea star is fairly small, and are often found clinging to the underside of rocks during low tides. The feed on mussels and barnacles, and are prey for the northern sun star, sunflower star, and birds.

Unlike most other sea stars, the six-rayed star females will actually brood their young. They lay their eggs, which are fertilized by sperm that has been released into the water column. The female then holds the eggs amongst her tube feet, near her mouth, until they hatch, which takes about 40 days, then for a few weeks afterwards, until the young move off on their own.
