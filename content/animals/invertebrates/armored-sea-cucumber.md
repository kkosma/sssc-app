The armored sea cucumber, or creeping pedal sea cucumber, is often mistaken for a chiton, especially when its feeding tentacles are retracted. Its scientific name even means “chiton-like”. This cucumber is flat on its underside, which allows it to cling to rocks and contributes to its chiton-like appearance. The dorsal side is covered in calcareous plates. They are suspension feeders, and extend their feeding tentacles into the water column to capture plankton and other small floating debris. Predators include larger sea stars, including the leather star and the sunflower star.

The armored cucumbers are broadcast spawners, and a large female can release over 35,000 eggs. These animals are fairly toxic to most predators, thanks to the large concentration of saponins in their tissues and tentacles.
