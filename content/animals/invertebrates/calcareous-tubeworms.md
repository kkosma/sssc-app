Calcareous tubeworms are a type of benthic, sessile marine annelid worm. Different species are found in every ocean of the world. They are filter feeders, and eat primarily detrital particles and plankton. They are fed on by predatory sea stars, such as the ochre star.

The only visible part of the tubeworm body is the colorful, fan-shaped crown that sticks out of the end of the tube. This crown aids in respiration and alimentation. They secrete and inhabit their calcareous tube, never leaving it. Since it relies on calcium carbonate found in the water column, it is susceptible to impacts of ocean acidification and climate change (for more information on ocean acidification, see the research section).
