The burrowing sea cucumber, or orange sea cucumber, gets its name from the way it keeps its body buried among rocks. The most visible part of this animal is its bright orange feeding tentacles, which resemble the branches of a tree when they are extended. The body colors vary from reddish-brown to pinkish brown, and it has 5 rows of brown tube feet along its body. They are filter feeders, extending their 10 branching tentacles into the water column to catch plankton and detritus. Predators include the leather star and other sea stars, and fish.

Sea cucumbers are broadcast spawners, and will release eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. Since these animals move slowly and have no eyes or teeth, they have had to adapt some unique defense mechanisms against predators. The body of a burrowing cucumber is made of a material that allows it to go from a solid to liquid state when triggered, thus allowing the animal to hide in small crevices before hardening back up. They also expel all the water in their bodies and contract their muscles into a hard, rounded ball. Their last, and possibly most drastic, line of defense is called evisceration. The animal ejects all of its internal organs, which it will regenerate if it gets to safety.
