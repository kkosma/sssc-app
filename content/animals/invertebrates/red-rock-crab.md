The red rock crab is a common crab in southeast Alaska. It is often confused with the much larger, and more sought after, Dungeness crab. The easiest way to tell the apart is that the red rock crab has black tipped claws, while the Dungeness do not. This crab is often dark red in color, with a lighter underside. It is widest at the 8th and 9th lateral tooth that line the edges of the carapace. They have an extremely varied diet, with over 42 species observed as prey, including barnacles, smaller crabs, sea cucumbers, and dead fish. Predators include sand and kelp bass, sculpins, and sea birds.

Mating typically happens in the summer, after a female has molted. The male will protect her before she molts, and until her carapace hardens up again after a molt, by carrying her under his body. A female may carry between 172,000 and 597,000 eggs. While not as commercially sought after as the Dungeness crab, there is a sizable recreational fishery for these crabs. As Dungeness face overharvesting pressure, some people are switching to red rock crabs as an alternative.
