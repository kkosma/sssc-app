The opalescent nudibranch is considered one of the prettiest nudibranchs, and is a favorite for underwater photographers. They are translucent white, and they have a furry-like appearance, due to the numerous orange and white cerata (respiratory organs) that project from its back. They have to sensory organs called rhinophores that project out from the head, almost like antennae. They feed primarily on hydroids and small anemones. They can actually incorporate the unfired stinging cells (or nematocysts) of anemones they have eaten into their cerata, giving them a defense against predators.

The opalescent nudibranch is hermaphroditic. When they mate, both animals will exchange sperm and eventually lay their eggs in small ribbons that resemble small sausages. They often have violent encounters with members of their own species, though. If two meet, they often engage in a biting battle, with the winner often eating the loser.
