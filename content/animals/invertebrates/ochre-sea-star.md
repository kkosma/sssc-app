Ochre stars are one of the most commonly seen sea stars in the Pacific northwest and southeast Alaska. These stars typically have 5 arms and are purple or orange in color, with short white spines along the top side. They exhibit radial symmetry, which means that each section with an arm is exactly like the others. Their favored prey item is mussels, but they are known to feed on barnacles, abalone, chitons, and snails. They eat buy everting their stomachs into the shell of the animal they are after, digesting it and absorbing the nutrients before bringing its stomach back into its own body. The only predators are sea otters and gulls.

Ochre sea stars are considered a keystone species, meaning the health of the population is often an indicator of bigger environmental factors and their presence or absence can affect other speciesâ€™ abundance. They are vital to the ecosystem because they help keep mussel populations down, which, if left unchecked, can overrun an area, crowding out other species. Like all sea stars, ochre stars are broadcast spawners, releasing eggs and sperm into the water.
