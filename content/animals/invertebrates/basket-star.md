Basket stars are the largest members of the taxonomic class Ophiuroidea, which also contains the brittle stars. It is a very deep-sea animal, and is not often seen by people, unless one catches a ride in a fishing net or on a crab or shrimp pot. They have five arms, like most sea stars, but the arms branch out ad infinitum to aid in capturing prey. Basket stars are suspension feeders, often sitting in areas with a strong current with all their branches extended to capture small zooplankton, such as copepods and jellyfish. The branches have small hooks on them to help ensnare prey, in addition to the mucus they can secrete to help trap prey. Predators include fish and large crabs.

Not much is known about basket stars reproductive habits, but it is assumed they are broadcast spawners, like most echinoderms. They have the ability to regenerate an arm if one is lost to a predator or other factor. They show a certain amount of site fidelity, often remaining in the same location for years, as long as food is abundant.
