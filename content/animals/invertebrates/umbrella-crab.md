The umbrella crab, also called the turtle crab, has a distinct carapace that completely covers its legs. One of the crab’s defense mechanisms is to pull its legs under the shell and get as low to the ground as possible. They come in a wide range of colors, from red to orange to white and gray. Sitka is the northern most limit of this crab’s range. They feed on coralline algae, and are prey for larger marine invertebrates, sea birds, and sea otters.

Not much is known about these small crabs. They are susceptible to kelp forest loss, since much of their life is spent in kelp forests and they rely on them for food.
