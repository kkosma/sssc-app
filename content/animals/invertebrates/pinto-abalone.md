The Pinto, or northern, abalone is one of the smallest abalone species. The outside of their shell can be red, pink, tan, or mottled, while the inside is mother of pearl. They eat mainly algae, and preyed upon by sea otters, octopuses, sea stars, and humans. 

Populations have been declining, due mostly to sea otter predation and overfishing. In Alaska, the pinto abalone is listed as a “species of concern”, which gives the government the opening to study them for conservation purposes. Abalone are extremely susceptible to overharvesting, due to its short larval stage, slow growth, and patchy distribution. While there is no commercial fishery for abalone in Alaska, there is a limited, personal use allotment. Individuals can harvest 5 per person, per day, the legal size is 89mm (3.5 inches), and they must free-dive for them (no SCUBA or other gear). They are also susceptible to the effects of ocean acidification. For more information, please see our research section on Coastal Resiliency.
