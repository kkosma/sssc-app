The Heath’s dorid comes in a variety of shades of yellow, from extremely pale to dark, almost orange color. They have small tubercles, and are sprinkled with small dark spots, usually clustered near the gill opening. They are often confused with the Monterey sea lemon, which is larger in size and has bigger tubercles and dark spots. It has the ability to retract its gills and rhinophores, which can alter its appearance and make identification more difficult. They primarily eat sponges.

There is not a lot of information available on the Heath’s dorid, other than the data that is used for identification purposes. It is unknown how they reproduce (are they hermaphrodites like most nudibranchs?) or what their main predators are.
