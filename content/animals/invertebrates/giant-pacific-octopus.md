The giant Pacific octopus is the largest octopus species in the world, averaging 16 feet across and weighing 110 pounds. The largest one ever recorded was 30 feet across and weighed 600 pounds. They are dark reddish brown in color, and have one of the most sophisticated camouflage systems of any animal. Through a series of color changing pigments, they can change their color to match almost any substrate, a feat made even more incredible by the fact that they are color-blind. They are incredibly intelligent, and can learn by observing. They are shy, solitary creatures that typically hunt at night. They prey on shrimp, clams, lobster and fish, and have been known to occasionally eat small sharks and diving birds. Predators include harbor seals, sea otters, sperm whales, and pacific sleeper sharks.

The giant Pacific octopus is extremely prolific, with female laying between 120,000 and 400,000 eggs. The will only mate once in their life. During breeding, a male transfers a spermatophore, or sperm packet, to a female, and she holds it until she is ready to fertilize her eggs. Once they are laid, she spends all her time tending the brood. She attaches the eggs to rocks, and continuously blows water over them and removes any algae that may try to grow on them. She stops eating during this time, and often dies soon after the eggs hatch.
