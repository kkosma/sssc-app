The vermilion star is a smaller sea star species, with five stump-like arms. It gets its name from its bright vermilion color on top, with a lighter orange underside. The aboral side is covered in small ossicles, or plate-like calcareous structures, that give the animal a distinctive texture. It is considered an omnivorous predator, because it feeds on bryozoans, sponges, sea pens, and detritus. Its only know predator is the morning sun star.

The vermilion star is a broadcast spawner. Females release eggs and males release sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. A unique trait of this animal is that it smells faintly of gunpowder.
