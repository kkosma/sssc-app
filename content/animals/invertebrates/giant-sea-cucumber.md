The giant sea cucumber, or California sea cucumber, is one of the largest cucumbers found in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. They have a long, cylindrical body that tapers slightly at each end and is covered in papillae, cone-shaped projections that resemble thorns. They are often dark red or reddish brown in color, but can also be lighter yellows or even white. They have 20 feeding tentacles at one end, that they use to gather detritus and plankton from the sediments and water. They move very slowly, with five rows of tube feet running along the underside. Main predators include the sunflower and leather stars, and sea otters. An interesting fact about sea cucumbers is they breathe out of their anus.

Sea cucumbers are broadcast spawners, and will release eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. Since these animals move slowly and have no eyes or teeth, they have had to adapt some unique defense mechanisms against predators. The first line is the way they look; all the papillae give it the appearance of being covered in sharp thorns, which may help deter predators. They also expel all the water in their bodies and contract their muscles into a hard, ovoid ball. Their last, and possibly most drastic, line of defense is called evisceration. The animal ejects all of its internal organs, which it will regenerate if it gets to safety. They are harvested commercially in Alaska, with very limited and specific openings, and they must be collected through diving methods, not nets or trawls.
