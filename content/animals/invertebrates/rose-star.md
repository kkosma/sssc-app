The rose star, also called the common sunstar, is a large sea star that comes in a variety of colors and patterns, which leads to them being called snowflake stars in some areas. They have a very slow growth rate, taking about 10 years to reach full size. While they can have from 8-13 arms, they almost always have 11. They are one of the fastest moving sea stars, with speeds up to 70cm (27.5 inches) a minute. They are omnivorous, and will eat almost anything they come across. Their preferred diet is bivalves, anemones, sea pens, nudibranchs, and other small invertebrates. Predators include the morning sun star and the sunflower star.

Like most sea stars, the rose star has distinct genders and are broadcast spawners. Larvae are lecithotropic, meaning they absorb the yolk from their egg as they grow. As they develop and get bigger, they tend to move into deeper water.
