This anemone has a pink or red column that is covered in small white spots. Like all anemones, this one is carnivorous, using its stinging tentacles to capture prey, such as sea urchins, mussels and crabs. This anemone is fed on by nudibranchs, sea stars, and snails.

In the wild, this anemone is often found in association with the Painted greenling (Oxylebius pictus). Juveniles will swim or rest in the tentacles, while adults can be found near the base. It is thought that the anemone provides protection against predators, while the greenling is not affected by the stinging nematocysts of the anemone.
