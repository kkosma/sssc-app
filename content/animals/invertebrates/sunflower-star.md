The sunflower star is one of the largest sea stars in the world, and is considered the fastest moving, gaining speeds of 3.3 feet per minute. They come in a variety of colors, and are remarkable soft-bodied, even though they do have small spines, which makes them look like squishy blobs when found out of the water. They are often found in kelp forests or urchin barrens, because sea urchins are one of their favorite prey. They can ingest an entire urchin whole, digest the animal, then expel an intact urchin test. They also feed on crabs, sea cucumbers, bivalves, smaller sea stars, snails and chitons. The only known predators are Alaskan king crab and some larger cancer crabs.

Sunflower stars are broadcast spawners, and when larvae first develop, they are bilaterally symmetrical. During the next larval phase, which happens at about 3 weeks, a third arm has developed. Once they settle, the young have only 5 arms, but as it grows, more arms develop until it reaches full size, with 24 arms and a whopping 15,000 tube feet.
