The lined chiton gets its name from a series of diagonal lines that run across the plates. They are varied in color, from blue to red to brown to yellow and orange. Its favorite food item is coralline algae, and they are often found in areas with high concentrations of algal growth. Its main predators are ochre sea stars and six-rayed stars, but they have been known to be taken by otters and sea birds. They are also frequently found near sea urchin beds, presumably as protection from predators.

Like all chitons, their shells are made up of a series of plates, which look like butterflies. When disturbed or picked up, the animal rolls itself into a ball to protect the soft underside.
