The helmet crab is one of the fastest moving crabs in the Pacific northwest. This true crab has four small teeth between the eyes instead of a rostrum. It is covered in stiff, club-shaped hairs called setae, which sets it apart from the invasive green crab, which it is often confused with. They prefer habitats with soft-sanded bottoms, especially eelgrass beds, where they can burrow down into the sand to hide. Their coloration, which ranges from greens to browns, makes them difficult to spot in kelp forests and eelgrass beds. They have a varied diet, from eelgrass and eelgrass detritus to snails and bivalves. It is preyed up by sea otters, fur seals, some fish, and birds.

They often come into shallow areas with a lot of algae covered rocks to mate. This happens after the female has molted, and her shell is soft. Some females have been known to store sperm from one season to the next, in case she is isolated from males during the next breeding season.
