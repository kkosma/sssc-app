The sand rose anemone is one of the largest anemones in the world, growing up to a meter across.  They are often partially or mostly buried in the sand.  The sand rose anemone has a red colored column with white tubercules arranged in circular rows around the columns.  This species is found in the subtidal zone, to a depth of about 45 meters.  Their diet consists of sea urchins, small fish, clams, mussels, and detritus.  Some of their predators are sea stars and nudibranchs.

Like all sea anemones, they are broadcast spawners, which means they release their gametes into the water column, where fertilization takes place.  They have a symbiotic relationship with the candy-stripe shrimp.
