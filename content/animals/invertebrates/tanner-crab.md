Tanner crabs, also known as snow crab, are a “true crab”, which encompasses all decapod crustaceans in the taxonomic sub-order Brachyura. They have five pair of legs, four walking pairs and one pair that have chelipeds, or pinchers, used for catching or grasping food. While larvae will feed on plankton, juveniles and adults are opportunistic omnivores and will eat anything they can, including bivalves, gastropods, other crabs, shrimp, and fish. Predators include groundfish, bearded seals, octopus, sea otters, and pacific halibut.

When a female reaches sexual maturity, she goes through what is called a terminal molt, meaning the last one, and she will mate for the first time. The male will protect her while after mating until her shell hardens up. Eggs are extruded with 48 hours, and she will carry the on her abdomen for a year before they hatch. Hard-shelled females will mate, usually in large aggregates, and can store sperm from one season to the next.
