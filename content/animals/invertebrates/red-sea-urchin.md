The red sea urchin is the largest urchin found in Alaskan waters. It has long spines, and its colors are range from dark red to burgundy, with the spines sometimes being a lighter color. They are herbivores, feeding mainly on giant kelp and bull kelp. They are often found in large aggregates with other urchins near food sources. They are mobile, but if food is abundant, they don’t move much. Predators include sea otters, sunflower stars, crab, octopus, and wolf eels.
Urchins are broadcast spawners, with spawning usually occurring between June and September. 

Urchins are harvested by humans for the roe and gonads, which are considered a delicacy in Japan. The relationship between kelp beds, urchins, and sea otters has played out quite dramatically in southeast Alaska. When otters were wiped out from the area, the urchin populations exploded and wiped out the kelp forests, creating areas known as “urchin barrens”. With the reintroduction of otters, the urchin populations have declined and kelp forests have rebounded, which provide abundant habitat to various other species.
