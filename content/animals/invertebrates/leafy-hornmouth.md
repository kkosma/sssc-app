The leafy hornmouth gets its name from the three large varices coming off its shell. This carnivorous snail is often found on rocky shore, in close proximity to barnacles and mussels, two of its favorite prey species. When feeding, it uses its radula to drill a hole in the targets shell, where it then injects digestive enzymes that liquefy the animal, allowing the hornmouth to slurp it up. Predators include sea stars and crabs.

Mating occurs in the spring and summer. Large groups gather to mate, then the females lay their eggs in yellow egg cases, about 40 a year, each one holding 25-80 eggs. The juveniles emerge from the cases anywhere from 4-10 months later.
