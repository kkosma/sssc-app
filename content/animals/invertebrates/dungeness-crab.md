The Dungeness crab (Dungie, for short) is one of the more well-known crab species. They are often found in shallower waters, and prefer a muddy or sandy bottom. They can, however, all be found in estuarine environments, due to a high tolerance for salinity changes. Their diet and foraging behavior can change depending on their habitat, and often scavenge prey that is hiding in the sand, but they are predatory also, and will actively hunt for live food. Prey items include bivalves, worms, shrimp, small fish and other small crabs. They have many predators, including birds, sea otters, sculpin, octopuses, and larger crabs, just to name a few.

There is a large commercial fishery for these crabs, as well as sport, subsistence, and personal use. They have been given a “Good Alternative” sustainable seafood rating by Seafood Watch, meaning that this species should be used instead of others that are not sustainably harvested or are farmed.
