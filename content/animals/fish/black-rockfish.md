Black rockfish adults are often a mottled gray color, with dark patches on their back. They are an opportunistic predator, often feeding on zooplankton, crab larvae, and fish, such as herring and sand lance. Predators include sablefish, Pacific halibut, king salmon, lingcod, bald eagles, and Steller sea lions. They have venomous spines, and are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs develop and hatch inside the female before being released. They are one of the few rockfish species that form large schools.

They are important to recreational fisheries, and most commercial fishing is done by hook and line gear, since their preferred habitat is not conducive to trawling. They are not considered a species of concern, as far as population numbers go, because the fisheries have been conservatively managed for years.
