The black prickleback can often be found under rocks during low tide. This fish can breathe air, so they can survive long stretches out of the water, as long as they are kept moist. They have an elongated body, with black bands with white edging radiating off the eyes. They prey upon crabs, amphipods, worms, and algae. Predators include sea birds and larger fish.

There have not been many studies into the pricklebacks. They are not thought to be threatened for any reason, and there is no harvest of them. They have an annual reproductive cycle, with spawning occurring in the spring. Eggs are deposited one at a time and fertilized, before being shaped into clusters by both parents. The males guard the nest, which takes about 3 weeks to hatch.
