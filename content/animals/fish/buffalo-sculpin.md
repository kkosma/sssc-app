The Buffalo sculpin is a camouflage master among fish. They are mottled, and their colors vary from green and pink to brown, depending on its environment. They camouflage so well that they are often missed by even experienced divers, and are often mistaken for rocks. Their preferred diet is algae, but they will also eat shrimps, crabs, amphipods, mussels, and small fish. They are preyed upon by river otters, in shallow waters, and other larger fish in deeper water.

Not much is known about Buffalo sculpin. They arenâ€™t a particularly economically valuable species, with most being caught by recreational fisherman and for display in aquariums. They often remain motionless when disturbed, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden.
