The kelp greenling is a small-to-medium size fish most often found in rocky shallows. The males and females differ significantly in appearance, with females being freckled all over, and males having irregular blue spots. They eat shrimp, crabs, worms, octopuses, brittle stars, snails, and small fish. Young kelp greenlings are preyed upon by larger predatory fish, such as lingcod, halibut, and salmon.

The kelp greenling is not a commercially important species, and, in fact, are often viewed as pests by commercial fisherman. They are often caught by shore or skiff fisherman, and are speared by divers.
