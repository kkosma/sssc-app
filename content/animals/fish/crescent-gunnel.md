The crescent gunnel is often found in tidepools and under rocks at low tide. It can breathe air, which allows it to survive out of water for long periods of time. It has an elongated body, with rows of crescent-shaped markings along its back. They have a cryptic coloration, which means their color can change depending on their surroundings. They feed on small crustaceans, mollusks, and worms, and are important prey for marine birds, larger fish, and mammals.

As a forage fish, direct fisheries of gunnels are prohibited in Alaska, and there are bycatch limits. The biggest threat to these fish is pollution destroying intertidal habitats, as well as strong storms scouring beaches.
