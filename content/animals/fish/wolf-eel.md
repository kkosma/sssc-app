Despite their name, wolf eels are not true eels. They have large pectoral fins that eels do not have. Their diet consists of hard-shelled invertebrates, such as crabs, urchins, and snail, as well as fish. They crush and chew their food with their powerful jaws, unlike most fish that swallowâ€™s food whole. The main predators of adults are harbor seals and other marine mammals, while most fish will prey upon the eggs and juveniles.

Wolf eels are thought to mate for life. They will often pair up at about 4 years of age, and start reproducing at 7 years of age. They will occupy the same den for several years, unless they are driven out by larger wolf eels or the Giant Pacific Octopus. While there is not a lot of hard data, populations are believed to be stable, due to the lack of interest from commercial or sports fisheries.
