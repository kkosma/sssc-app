The Quillback is one of the more than 60 species of rockfish found in Alaskan waters. Its scientific name, maliger, comes from Latin roots meaning “I bear a mast”, probably in reference to its high dorsal fin. This fish preys upon crustaceans, small fish and snails, and is preyed upon by larger fish, such as lingcod and yelloweye rockfish, as well as Steller sea lions and orcas. They have venomous spines, and can interbreed with Brown and Copper rockfish. They are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young.

Quillbacks are a commercially important species, and are easy to catch, even by novice anglers. In southeast Alaska, they make a croaking sound when caught. They are solitary animals, and are often found in open areas where cover is close by.
