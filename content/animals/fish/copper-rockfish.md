The Copper is one of the more than 60 species of rockfish found in Alaskan waters. The first specimen recorded was caught in Sitka. They prey upon squid, other fish, octopuses, and crabs, and are preyed upon by cormorants, heron, lingcod, chinook salmon, larger rockfish, and seals and sea lions. They have venomous spines, and are known to interbreed with Brown and Quillback rockfish. They are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young, with a 10-month gestation period.

Coppers are very common, and have a large commercial importance from southeast Alaska to San Diego, California. However, there is evidence that populations are declining, and there are regional overfishing concerns. They are usually found in rocky areas, and almost never in sandy-bottom areas.
