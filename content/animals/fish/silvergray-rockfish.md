Despite their name, Silvergray rockfish are not always silver, but can range in colors from green to dark gray, with a cream, pink, or white underside. It is considered slim, compared to other rockfish, and has reduced head spines. They prey upon smaller fish, crustaceans, and invertebrates, and predators include larger fish, birds, and some sharks. Silvergrays are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs are carried and hatched inside the female.

While not an extremely important commercial fish in Alaska, they are more important from British Columbia to Oregon. In Alaska, most catch is incidental in trawls and on longlines, although there is a small recreational catch in southern southeast Alaska (around Ketchikan).
