The staghorn sculpin gets its name from the antler-shaped projections coming off the gill covers. They are greyish olive green in color, with bands on its pectoral fins and second dorsal fin. They are found in nearshore or brackish waters, often burying themselves in the sand. They have the ability to breathe air, and can move out of exposed tidepools if the conditions deteriorate. They feed on a variety of invertebrates. They are often an unwanted bycatch in commercial and sport fishermenâ€™s nets.

After mating, the staghorn sculpin female lays her eggs in clusters on the muddy or sandy bottoms of estuaries. As the larvae develop, they move off in all directions, including upstream into fresh water.
