The shiner perch is one of the most abundant of the surfperch found along the west coast of the United States. It has a laterally compressed oval body, relatively large eyes, and a single dorsal fin. They are typically a silvery color, but can be dusky or greenish on the back. They are characterized by vertical yellow bars on the body. They can survive in less saline waters and are often found in coastal wetlands. They feed primarily on small crustaceans, mollusks, worms, and fish eggs.

Shiner perch males are sexually mature as soon as they are born, even though they probably donâ€™t mate due to larger male competition. Males change color to almost completely black when they are courting a female. They are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young, which are essentially miniature adults. A female can hold the sperm from a male after mating until her ova are ripe, then fertilization happens. The eggs hatch internally, and are carried by the female for about 12 months before they are born.
