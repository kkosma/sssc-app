The Brown rockfish is one of the smaller of the more than 60 species of rockfish found in Alaska. They live alone or in small groups, near the seafloor and in water more turbid than most other rockfish. They prey upon small fish, crab, shrimp, and other small invertebrates. Predators include king salmon and harbor seals. They have venomous spines, and will often interbreed with Quillback and Copper rockfish.

Browns are not a particularly important commercial species, especially in Alaska. They have some importance further south, especially for the live-fish fishery.
