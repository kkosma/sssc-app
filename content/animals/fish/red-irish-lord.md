The Red Irish Lords are a type of sculpin. Often found in tide pools and rocky shallows, they are an ambush predator, and will feed on crabs, mussels, barnacles, and smaller fish. Predators include river otters and large fish.

Red Irish Lords are typically red or pink, with white, brown, and black mottling. They can change their colors to blend in with their surroundings, and are often overlooked in the wild. They stay very still when disturbed, trusting in their camouflage to keep them hidden. While there are no population estimates for this fish, they are fairly common in the north Pacific.
