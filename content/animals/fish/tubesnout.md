Tubesnouts are often found in large schools in kelp beds, eelgrass, rocky areas or over sandy bottoms. They have an elongated, rigid body and a long, tube-shaped snout with a small mouth. They are a mottled brown color, with olive green and yellowish brown. They are filter feeders, and eat mainly planktonic crustaceans, like mysids and crab larvae.

Tubesnouts have some intricate breeding habits. The male stakes out the area and makes a nest, usually with kelp that it has bound with sticky genital fluid. The male is typically accompanied by up to 10 females, who will take turns laying her eggs in clusters, where the male fertilizes them. The male then defends the nest for about 3 weeks before the larvae hatch.
