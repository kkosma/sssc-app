These small fish are the most commonly encountered fish in tidepools. They can sometimes be found under rocks or logs during low tides. They can breathe air, which allows them to survive for a period of time out of water. They prey on small crustaceans, worms, isopods, and barnacles, and are often preyed upon by larger fish and sea birds. They have the ability to smell predators, which causes them to go into hiding mode.
