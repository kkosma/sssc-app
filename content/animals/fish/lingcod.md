The lingcod is not a true cod, it is actually part of the Greenling family. Their color is variable, usually with dark brown or copper splotches, but also with purple or gray colors. They are voracious predators, and will eat almost anything they can fit in their mouths, which contain 18 very sharp teeth. Adults are most preyed upon by seals, sea lions, and humans, while the young are prey to bigger lingcod and other fish. They can grow to be over 80 pounds.

Lingcod have long been important to the diet of the native Northwest inhabitants. Numbers have been reduced due to overfishing, especially during the breeding season, when males guarding a nest are taken, which results in the loss of the nest as well as the breeding adult.
