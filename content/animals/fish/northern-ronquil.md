The northern Ronquil is a fish that prefers cold water. They are only found in the Arctic and northern Pacific Ocean, about as far south as Monterey, California. They have an elongated body, and a continuous dorsal fin that runs its entire length. Males and females differ in their color patterns, with males being orange on the dorsal side and olive green on the belly, with a blue and black anal fin, and females being olive green dorsally, and a lighter color ventrally. They eat small benthic crustaceans and mollusks, and are preyed upon by halibut and flounder.

Ronquils are a secretive species, and, while considered to be fairly common, they are rarely observed. Nothing definitive is known about their reproductive habits.
