Sablefish, also known as black cod, is a deep-sea fish often found in areas of soft substrate. They are typically dark grey or black on top, with lighter grey bellies. They are opportunistic feeders, and their diet changes based on geographic region and what phase of their life cycle they are in. They feed mostly on fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. The largest predator of adult sablefish is Sperm whales, with juveniles being preyed upon by Chinook and Coho salmons. Juveniles are often found in shallow waters and around kelp beds, which provide some protection.

There is a decent commercial fishery for sablefish in Alaska, and a bigger one in Japan. These fish are typically caught on longlines, from great depth. They play an integral role in one of the ongoing research projects, the Southeast Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project (SEASWAP), which has researchers working with fisherman to determine ways to avoid sperm whales while fishing, since the whales have figured out how to strip the fish off on longlining gear (for more information, check out the research section).
