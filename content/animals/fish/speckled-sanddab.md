The speckled sanddab is a bottom-dwelling flatfish. Like all flatfishes, it has eyes on both sides of its head and swims upright when it is born; as it grows, it turns on its right side and the right eye migrates to the left side of the head. It prefers areas with sandy substrate, and is usually white or brown or black and heavily spotted, which allows it to hide in the sand undetected. They prey on small crustaceans, worms, clams, and small fish, and predators include marine mammals, birds, and bigger fish.

Sanddabs are oviparous, and females will produce numerous eggs in multiple spawnings over a season. It is not a commercially important species, due to its small size.
