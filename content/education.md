We have programs for preschool students, primary school students, high school students, college students and adults. In addition to our education programs we also participate in and produce science outreach opportunities for the community which are diverse and interdisciplinary, such as subsistence wisdom, science as art, and storytelling. We partner with many local and national organizations to make our programs happen, including the Sitka Tribe of Alaska, Sitka National Historic Park, University of Alaska Southeast, National Science Foundation, and many more.
